      <h2>Vancouver Challenges & Prizes</h2>
      <p>The Vancouver node of the Space Apps Challenge will be emphasizing three of the many challenges suggested by NASA. Participants are welcome to compete in any of the challenges, but in order to keep things cohesive we decided to focus on three that we felt the Vancouver teams could really knock out of the park.</p>
      <p><em>All solutions built at the event must be submitted under a license that permits the free and open dissemination of the work.</em> The day of, we'll have details on how to host your project with us on <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>.</p>
      <p>The Vancouver location will be giving out special prizes for the challenge categories listed below.</p>

      <div class="challenge">
        <h3>Open Data Challenge - Kepler</h3>
        <p>The challenge is to help NASA either a) make Kepler data more accessible or b) create something amazing with it. It could be an app that better visualizes the data, an interface that presents the data in a new way, an infographic that helps understand the data in a new way, or more.</p>
        <p>The centuries-old quest for other worlds like our Earth has been rejuvenated by the intense excitement and popular interest surrounding the discovery of hundreds of planets orbiting other stars. There is now clear evidence for substantial numbers of three types of exoplanets: gas giants, hot-super-Earths in short period orbits, and ice giants. The following websites are tracking the day-by-day increase in new discoveries and are providing information on the characteristics of the planets as well as those of the stars they orbit: The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, NASA Exoplanet Archive, New Worlds Atlas, and Current Planet Count Widget. The challenge now is to find terrestrial planets (i.e., those one half to twice the size of the Earth), especially those in the habitable zone of their stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist. The Kepler Mission, NASA Discovery mission #10, is specifically designed to survey a portion of our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover dozens of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone and determine how many of the billions of stars in our galaxy have such planets. Data from this mission will allow us to place our solar system within the continuum of planetary systems in the Galaxy.</p>

        <h3>NASA Planetary Data System Interface</h3>
        <p>Develop a tool for citizen scientists, educators, and students to access NASA’s Planetary Data System data sets, which is available at <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/">http://pds.nasa.gov/</a>. Tools for viewing and working with this data are found <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/index.shtml">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>HTML5 App to access NASA Earth Observations website</h3>
        <p>Develop a stand-alone HTLM5 tablet app that would reach a large number of citizen scientists using Earth Science Data from the NASA Earth Observations (NEO) website (<a href="http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov">http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov</a>). The website currently provides access to a wide array of missions and instrument data, and the ability to statistically analyze the information. It is focused on Earth Science, but will be extended to include planetary systems datasets in the future. NASA is currently building an app called “Science on a Sphere SOS” that allows the user to use the capabilities of the NEO website. NASA is look for help extending the analysis and animation capability in the NEO on SOS app. To complete the continuum from website to SOS, a stand-alone HTLM5 tablet app would reach a large number of citizen scientists. The current work is close to being able to run as a web-app on a tablet.</p>

      <div class="challenge">
        <h3>Best Cross-platform App</h3>
        <p>This is a special challenge for all apps that are entered at the Vancouver location. With next-generation devices emerging in a variety of screen sizes and running many different operating systems, the issue of cross-platform compatibility is a crucial consideration in app development. To be eligible for this category, demo your final app to us on (3) or more devices (your laptop can count as one, and at the event we're sure to have a variety of mobiles and tablets) and show us it looks great. Responsive design, Cordova (PhoneGap), and SproutCore are a few examples of where your cleverness could be well spent for this category.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p>Please review the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/faq/">FAQ on the flagship site.</a></p>
        <div class="question">
          <p><span>Q.</span> How much does it cost to enter?</p>
          <p><span>A.</span> This event is free. Spots are limited to 50 participants at the Vancouver location. That's all we can fit, so sign up before all the spots are gone. We'll also be providing some healthy lunch from Vancouver's best local fare. No pizza.</p>
          <p><span>Q.</span> Can I work in a team?</p>
          <p><span>A.</span> We <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to work in a team. If possible, form your team with your friends in advance. Take some time to look at the challenge you'll be working on and form a plan. Don't have anyone to form a team with yet? No problem. Vancouver developers are friendly and you'll be able to find a team to join on the morning of April 21st.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <p><span>Q.</span> Can I work by myself?</p>
          <p><span>A.</span> Absolutely. Although we encourage team effort, we're not going to get in your way about how you want to work on the challenge. Working by yourself is cool too.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <p><span>Q.</span> I'm a designer. Can I participate too?</p>
          <p><span>A.</span> Part of the success of these apps is going to depend on making them usable and appealing. We need your input on user experience, interaction design, and some wonderful graphics to make these apps reach a wide audience. Bring your mad Photoshop skills and front-end development chops to the hackathon, we need you!</p>

    	<h2>Step-by-step instructions for getting at the Kepler data:</h2>
      
      <h3>0 / DO THIS NOW</h3> 
      <p>There's a bunch of (easy) overhead to deal with
      before getting at the Kepler data, but it takes a few minutes.  This
      tutorial is about 30 minutes long; once you work through it, you will
      know how to search and prep the Kepler data (including extracting it
      from the special astronomy-preferred format it comes packaged in, if
      this is important to you), which you may want to have all done before
      the Space Apps Challenge weekend, so you can focus on the challenge!</p>
      
      <h3>1 / Registering</h3>
      <p>In order to access Kepler data, NASA wants you to register with its site.  Go to
      <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/registration/registration_form.html">the registration page</a>
      and fill it out.  A user and pass will be emailed to you immediately.</p>
      
      <h3>2 / Searching for Kepler data</h3>
      <p>A giant query form is available
      <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/data_search/search.php">here</a>.  
      You can play around with fields later, but for now just hit the green
      highlighted 'search' button.</p>
      
      <h3>3 / Looking at the search results</h3>
      <p>A table of search returns will be presented with a ton of information
      in it; all the column headings are explained
      <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/help/columns.html">here</a>.  
      but don't worry about most of them now.  The only two you care about
      on your first pass are:</p>
      <p>Mark (very leftmost): if an entry is highlighted yellow in this
      column, the Kepler team hasn't released the dataset to the public;
      ignore these.</p>
      <p>Condition Flag (very rightmost): If not blank, will have a
      human-readable comment on anything interesting in the data run.</p>
      
      <p>Look for any data run with Condition Flag = 'Planetary candidate', and
      check its box in the 'Mark' column.  Now hit the 'Plot Marked Light
      Curves' button at the top of the page.  A plot of the selected data
      run will be displayed; time is on the horizontal axis, and the amount
      of light observed from the star is displayed vertically.  The
      'Planetary candidate' ones should show a bunch of downward-pointing
      spikes on their light curves; these mark when a planet passed in front
      of the star and blocked some of its light - that's how the Kepler
      experiment identifies the presence of a new planet!</p>
      
      <h3>4 / Retrieve Kepler Data</h3>
      <p>Go back to the search results of the previous step, and hit the
      'Submit marked data for retrieval from STDADS' button at the top.
      You'll be shown a list of all the files that will be packaged for your
      retrieval; hit the 'Submit marked data for retrieval from STDADS' on
      this page as well, and you'll be taken to a page that asks you how you
      want your data served to you; you'll probably want it either sent to
      your ftp server, or staged on their ftp server for you to grab.
      Notice the 'Compress the files using gzip' option in the same
      dialogue, enter your user and pass you got from step 1 at the top, and
      hit the 'Send retrieval request to ST-DADS' button.  If all is well,
      you'll be sent to a page titled 'Request Sent to Kepler DADS'.</p>
      
      <p>Wait a minute, and then check the email you gave NASA when you
      registered.  You will receive two emails: the first acknowledges that
      your request is pending, and the second will contain the line 'REQUEST
      DELIVERY STATUS: SUCCESS' if all completed successfully.  If you chose to
      have the files staged on their ftp server, you
      can pull the results to your local computer with your ftp client of
      choice, following the path indicated in the email that told you all
      was well.</p>
      
      <h3>5 / Reading Kepler Data</h3>
      <p>The astronomy community has adopted an industry standard file format
      for visualizing and archiving their data, .FITS.  You'll need to get a
      viewer to read these; there's a list
      <a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_viewer.html">here</a>; fv works with no problems in OS X 10.5.8,
      available for free
      <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/fv/">here</a>.</p> 
      
      <h3>6 / fv</h3>
      <p>After downloading fv, unzip the Kepler data you got in step 4 if you
      haven't already, and navigate to it via the dialogue that pops up when
      you open fv.  Open up any *llc.fits file and then from the new
      dialogue that pops up:</p>
      <p>1. Click on the 'index' box with extension 'LIGHTCURVE'</p>
      <p>2. Hit the 'Hist' button to the right in the same row</p>
      <p>3. In the window that pops up, choose 'TIMECORR' from the dropdown
      labeled 'X' and 'SAP_FLUX' from the dropdown labeled 'Y'.  Hit the
      'Make' button at the bottom and a histogram of the data appears
      similar to the one you saw on the website.</p>
      <p>4. Close the plot window, as well as the other one that popped up with
      it and the one with the 'X' and 'Y' columns in it.  In the window
      where you first checked the 'LIGHTCURVE' box, hit the 'All' button in
      the same row.</p>
      <p>5. A new window appears with all the data in table form.  Click on
      'File..Save' and follow the instructions to make a human-readable .txt
      dump of all the information in the file; this may be useful for
      escaping from the .FITS format (if you so choose) and doing your own thing with the data!</p>
